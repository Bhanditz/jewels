Parts of a fight
================

#Krieg
'Krieg' comes from the German school of medieval swordsmanship, and originally referred to a distance and the concomitant realities. Within Krieg there is no need to close, and there is no time for conscious thought. Krieg is like speed chess.

The arts that teach Krieg are Qin Na and Rondel Dagger.

#Closing

#Opening

#Distance

#Angle

The arts that teach Angle are One Step and Three Step.

#Timing

#Crispness

The arts that teach Crispness are Long Patterns and Singular Patterns.

#Uncrispiness

#Rhythm

#Komi
'Komi' is the ability to get into your opponents head and predict their actions, or to condition them so that they will take a certain action when you trigger them.

The arts that teach Komi are Triangular Pyramid Pushing Hands, and No-Contact Throws.

#Tactility

#Balance

#Speed

#Power
Power is not just plain strength; many of the techniques to build strength in the modern day do not build power. Deep power takes a very long time to gain, but is with you even as an old person or someone who is injured or unfit. It is in a large sense neuromuscular rather than just muscular, and is also to do with not building up muscles that act against each other, and learning how to let your muscles work with the least wasted strength.

The arts that teach Power are Deep Stance Exaggerated Repetitive Drills, Performing Rubies and to a lesser extent Amethysts with and then without different forms of isometrics, and Sinking-Striking drills.


#Dexterity

#Fluidity

#Killing Intent
'Killing Intent' is more than simply the willingness to kill; having killing intent, one will grasp at any opportunity to kill your enemy without hesitation it is true, but it is much more even then that. Killing intent means having no filters or boundaries in your mind that make thoughts unthinkable, and not flinching from painful thoughts. You have to be able to accept the possibility of your own death without flinching, and be able to see every way that you could effectively act within the conflict in order to realistically estimate the best course of action in a situation that may turn deadly. This may not involve killing; if one is possessed of Killing Intent one will swallow pride and allow a painful humiliating defeat in order to avoid escalation or harm to a loved one or bystander if that is the best outcome you can calculate.

As I am more merciful than my teachers, I will give no details of the ancient methods for learning Killing Intent, and my art does not use them.

The art that teaches Killing Intent involves visualisation exercises, guided discussions, and the application of enough psychic pressure by the teacher to very carefully fracture the student's mind repeatedly, though I shall write no more about it.
