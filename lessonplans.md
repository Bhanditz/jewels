  Stance review:
    Bow Stance
    Forward stance
    Horse stance
    Cat stance
  New stances:
    Unicorn stance - several variations
    Tiger stance
    Crane stance
    3/2 stance (like White Eyebrow)
    Broken Dragon stance (3/2 stance with bent back leg)
    Mantis stance (Deathkick - front heel)

Talk about cultural hegemony and orientalism, how many systems have tried to 'absorb all' but ultimately failed. Mention Kant, and expand if there is interest. Good intentions are not enough. The failure mode that is closest to success is through forcing everything into a 'grand unified system' - so, these stances make sense in terms of a certain (predominantly Kung Fu based) way of looking at things, and are necessary groundwork before I can teach you a lot of other things. But I am also going to teach you things that will not conceptually work with this at all, such as Bladewalking and Heavylight walking.

Talk about Aikido, Atemi, and communion with higher powers.

Dispersed and concentrated energy. Compliance. Nage and Uke. The role of atemi in compliance. Forcing Compliance is Komi.

Training. You are what you practice. The problem of simulation. Horrendous injuries. Randori. Limits of training affecting a martial art.

Out of stance.
