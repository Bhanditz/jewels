The Art
-------

The Art is like a collection of jewels. Each type of jewel corresponds to a different way of thinking about the art.

##The Sapphires

The Sapphires are the parts of a fight. If you were to analyse a fight, talking about phases or dominating aspects, those are the Sapphires. If you were to analyse a fighter, talking about essence rather than technique or movements, that is also the Sapphires.

The Sapphires are Krieg, Closing, Opening, Distance, Angle, Timing, Crispness, Uncrispiness, Rhythm, Komi, Tactility, Balance, Speed, Power, Dexterity, Fluidity, and Killing intent.

##The Rubies

The Rubies are kinds of individual things a fighter does. That is, each ruby is a family of related individual techniques. These techniques are simple, rather than the complexity of the Amythysts - they are to be used simultaneously or pervasively, rather than sequentially like a unique key fitting into a lock.

The Rubies are Walking, Falling, Striking, Breathing and Shouting.

##The Amythysts

The Amythysts are complex movements which can be used to fit together like a jigsaw, or inserted like a key into the correct space in a fight. They usually use the whole body, from stance through to fine position of limbs.

##The Emeralds

The Emeralds are families of principles. There are exercises that teach each principle, but there are no exercises that teach the princigenitor, the Ur Way. The principles guide the application of the other parts of the Way.

The Emeralds are The Defeats and The Strikes.
